23rd Feb, 2018 was my last day at Urban Science.

I joined Urban Science in April 2014 and it‚Äôs been a great ride since day1. I was fortunate to work with some amazing people from whom I have learned a ton of stuff, both technical and non-technical.

On March 5th,2018, I started my next adventure at Microsoft! I am super excited to be part of a company whose vision is to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more. I joined a sub team under the Windows & Devices Group.
 

I moved to Redmond, WA three weeks ago and still trying to recover from the jetlag (EST to PST time zone) and the üå¶Ô∏è weather.
