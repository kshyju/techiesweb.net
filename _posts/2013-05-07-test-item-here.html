<p>If you are using jQuery mobile in your web page ( with their css ( default theme or whatever)), it will usually override your styles for input elements like this<br />
But If you want to to ignore those styles offered by jQuery mobile and want to use the awesome styles your UI designer created, you can do that by simply adding data-role attribue to the input element with value set to "none"</p>
<p>If you are working with ASP.NET MVC3 razor, you can use this syntax</p>
<p>In this case it is the underscore instead of the dash. ASP.NET MVC will automatically convert this underscore to a dash when in render the Text box</p>
