<p>When Working with MVC Model Validations, You may come across a situation where you think you filled all the Required Items in the Form and submitted, but still the <code>ModelState.IsValid</code> property is returning false. I came across this scenario once when i was inherting Â a ViewModel from another ViewModel. How do we know what is causing the IsValid property to return false ?</p>
<p>You can check the <code>ViewData.ModelState.Values</code> collection and see what are the Errors. Here is the sample code</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<pre class="brush:csharp">[Httpost]
public ActionResult Create(User model)
{
   if(ModelState.IsValid)
   {
     //Save and redirect
   }
   else
   {
     foreach (var modelStateVal in ViewData.ModelState.Values)
     {
       foreach (var error in modelStateVal.Errors)
       {               
          var errorMessage = error.ErrorMessage;
          var exception = error.Exception;
          // You may log the errors if you want
       }
     }
   }         
   return View(model);
 }
}</pre>
