<p>I created a new wordpress theme and thought of sharing back to the community :) .</p>
<p>I was not doing any kind of wordpress stuff for the past 2-3 years, but  happened to attend the wonderful <a href="http://annarborgivecamp.org/">ann arbor give camp</a> this year where our team did some wordpress customization(which includes a custom theme creation) for the non-profit organization <a href="http://www.enlighten.com/2012/09/hacking-for-charity/">we were working with.</a> This made me think about creating a new theme and i jumped in!</p>
<p>This theme is developed on top of StudioPress theme from <a href="http://www.dailyblogtips.com/studiopress-wordpress-theme-released/">dailyblogtips</a>.  My special thanks to them. :)</p>
<p>I named the theme as "TechiesWebMetro".  Hope you like it.</p>
