Yesterday, I gave a talk about Web Performance APIs at [Seattle JavaScript user group](https://www.meetup.com/seattlejs/events/dczsvkyxmbrb/).

This was the first time I gave a public talk in front of such a big audience, over 130 people!

The talk was primarily focused on the web performance APIs and how we can use those to build a delightful web experience for the users. This was an updated(hence bit longer) version of the same talk I gave last month at Microsoft web developer meetup, an internal monthly meeting occurs at building 92 for the web dev community inside Microsoft.

The slides are available [here](http://bit.ly/shyju_perf-timeline)

This was an opportunity for me to learn a few things about public presentation. Thanks to Nolan, an ex-microsoft edge perf pm, who reviewed my slide deck and provided some useful tips and inspiration.

Cheers
