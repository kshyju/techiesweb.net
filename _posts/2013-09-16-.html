<p>You have a DataSet with datatables in it. You want to delete some records(rows) from the data table before using the dataset to bind to a grid view or sending that to another place. What you do for that ?</p>
<p>To delete the record from the data set's data table, you can use the DataRow.Delete method.</p>
<p>var dataTable = dataSet.Tables[0];</p>
<p>int rowIndex=0;</p>
<p>foreach (DataRow dRow in dataTable.Rows)<br />
{</p>
<p>dataTable.Rows[rowIndex].Delete();</p>
<p>rowIndex++</p>
<p>}</p>
<p>Now let's say you are using this modified data set as the data source to bind to a datagrid</p>
