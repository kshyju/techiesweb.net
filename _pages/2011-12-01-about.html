Hi there, my name is Shyju and i am a curious developer who is passionate about learning new things and building useful stuff. I use this blog as a platform to scribble down little tips and tricks which might help me/others in future.

[I am a former ASP.NET MVP](http://techiesweb.net/2016/10/10/mvp-award-2016-ThankYou.html)

My cv on stackoverflow : [http://stackoverflow.com/story/kshyju](href="http://stackoverflow.com/story/kshyju">)

A product designer by heart with a lot of love for minimalistic design, I fulfill my cravings by shipping cool new features to the open source project management software [TeamBins](http://www.teambins.com)

I built a [native IOS app from scratch](http://techiesweb.net/2017/01/04/building-a-native-ios-app.html) which i am very proud of :) I also created [2 VSTS extensions](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/search?term=publisher%3A%22Shyju%20K%22&target=AzureDevOps&category=All%20categories&sortBy=Relevance). Give it a try :)

I have a twitter account where i mostly retweet useful stuff for developers,primarily related to the dotnet & javascript eco system. [@kshyju](https://twitter.com/kshyju)
